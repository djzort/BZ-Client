Revision history for Perl extension BZ::Client.

4.4004 Wednesday Janurary 20 07:36 2021
    - Fix GH#6 bug

4.4003 Tuesday September 21 22:02 2020

4.4002 Friday May 25 07:53 2017
    - Major enhancements to BZ::Client::Bug::Attachment's add() method
    - If you just provide a file_name, add() will try to slurp the file (silently failing)
    - BZ::Client::XMLRPC now properly encodes and decodes base64 (i.e. attachments)
    - Base64 stuff is inspired by Raphael Crochet via RT#121581
    - Some other adjustments inside BZ::Client::XMLRPC which make me happier with it
    - Similarly, some style changes in BZ::Client::API
    - If you are using logDirectory, the content of error response will now be dumped out rather than just headers
    - Pod is now being spell checked (which resulted in lots of spelling fixes in pod)
