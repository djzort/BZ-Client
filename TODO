Bring all the objects together (like Search::Elasticsearch) - do this in 5.0

testing
 - User.pm tests, need to test create() & update(). Needs something other than landfill.bugzilla.org
 - have travis set up bugzilla and run admin function tests? docker is doable
 - have travis testing run with NO_NETWORK_TESTING
 - have tests for everything 5.0 can do, just against landfill.bugzilla.org for now
