BZ-Client version 1.0
=====================

This module provides a client for the so-called Bugzilla Webservices
API. (Which is, in fact, an XML-RPC API.)

See

  http://www.bugzilla.org/docs/tip/en/html/api/Bugzilla/WebService.html

for details on the server side API.


INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you'd like to run the integration tests (requires a running Bugzilla
server), do the following instead:

   perl Makefile.PL --testUrl=<url> --testUser=<user> --testPassword=<pwd>

replacing <url>, <user>, and <pwd> with your servers URL and your user
name and password on this server.
