=head1 SYNOPSIS

This class provides methods for accessing and managing attachments in Bugzilla. Instances of this class are returned by L<BZ::Client::Bug::Attachment::get>.

  my $client = BZ::Client->new( url       => $url,
                                user      => $user,
                                password  => $password );

  my $comments = BZ::Client::Bug::Attachment->get( $client, $ids );

=head1 CLASS METHODS

This section lists the class methods, which are available in this module.

=head2 get

It allows you to get data about attachments, given a list of bugs and/or attachment ids.

Note: Private attachments will only be returned if you are in the insidergroup or if you are the submitter of the attachment.

Actual Bugzilla API method is "attachments".

=head3 History

Added in Bugzilla 3.6.

=head3 Parameters

Note: At least one of L</ids> or L</attachment_ids> is required.

In addition to the parameters below, this method also accepts the standard L<BZ::Client::Bug/include_fields> and L<BZ::Client::Bug/exclude_fields> arguments.

=over 4

=item ids

I<ids> (array) - An array that can contain both bug IDs and bug aliases. All of the attachments (that are visible to you) will be returned for the specified bugs.

=item attachment_ids

I<attachment_ids> (array) - An array of integer attachment ID's.

=back

=head3 Returns

A hash containing two items is returned:

=over 4

=item bugs

This is used for bugs specified in L</ids>. This is a hash, where the keys are the numeric ID's of the bugs and the value is an array of attachment obejcts.

Note that any individual bug will only be returned once, so if you specify an ID multiple times in L</ids>, it will still only be returned once.

=item attachments

Each individual attachment requested in L</attachment_ids> is returned here, in a hash where the numeric L</attachment_id> is the key, and the value is the attachment object.

=back

The return value looks like this:

 {
     bugs => {
         1345 => [
             { (attachment) },
             { (attachment) }
         ],
         9874 => [
             { (attachment) },
             { (attachment) }
         ],
     },

     attachments => {
         234 => { (attachment) },
         123 => { (attachment) },
     },
 }

An "attachment" as shown above is an object instance of this package.
