=head1 SYNOPSIS

This class provides methods for accessing and managing Flags in Bugzilla.

 my $client = BZ::Client->new( url       => $url,
                               user      => $user,
                               password  => $password );

 my %results     = BZ::Client::FlagType->get( $client, \%params );
 my $id = BZ::Client::FlagType->create( $client, \%params );
 my @updates = BZ::Client::FlagType->update( $client, \%params );

=head1 CLASS METHODS

This section lists the class methods, which are available in this module.

The component provided does not exist in the product.

 $id = BZ::Client::FlagType->create( $client, \%params );

This allows you to create a new Flag Type in Bugzilla.

=item inclusions

I<inclusions> (array) An array of strings or a hash containing product names,
and optionally component names. If you provide a string, the flag type will be shown on all
bugs in that product. If you provide a hash, the key represents the product name, and the
value is the components of the product to be included.

For example:

 [ 'FooProduct',
    {
      BarProduct => [ 'C1', 'C3' ],
